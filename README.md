### Why build it?
In an effort to keep my development skills and knowledge fresh, I needed an interesting project to build. I'm building a fictional academy for those gifted individuals. *This is in no way associated with or representative of the original proprietors of these concepts.*

### What does it do?
The academy has two primary functions for participants at this time. 
1. Quests - Each participant may, at the appropriate time, join a quest, complete the quest objectives, and receive experience points. 
2. Experience - Another non-objective-based task may be completed for experience points as well. This is more generic, but it is just as important.

As the academy participant gains more experience, the rank may increase. There are predetermined ranks, and each rank will turn on new abilities.

The reward system built into the academy permits the redemption of rewards. Each reward point earned allows the participants to gain a new ability. Abilities are limited by the minimum rank.

### What technology is behind this?
1. A database contains the reference data, quest details, knowledge (experience), students, and rewards. It also permits the login of all the participants.
2. A web application permits a responsive interface to interact with various part of the academy. 
3. A continuous integration and deployment system is found here to keep the site and database up to date. 
*The site is built with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core*
